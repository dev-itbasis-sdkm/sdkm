== TODO

see link:TODO.adoc[]

== Install

. Unpack to any directory.
For example, in `$HOME/.sdkm/` (further this path in the documentation will be referred to as
`SDKM_HOME`)
. (Optional) Add the path to `$SDKM_HOME` to `PATH` - if you use hooks, this will be done automatically
. Unpack scripts for shims: `./sdkm reshim`
. Enjoy icon:smile-o[]

== Terminal hooks

. ZSH
+
It is necessary to add the line `source $SDKM_HOME/hook.zsh` to `~/.zshrc`

. Bash
+
It is necessary to add the line `source $SDKM_HOME/hook.bash` to `~/.bashrc`

== Caching available versions

To optimize the number of requests, the application caches the list of received SDK versions in `$SDKM_HOME/.cache` for a day
